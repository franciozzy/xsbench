Description
-----------
  xsbench is a suite of scripts written to facilitate the deployment of VMs
  for performance benchmarks. It includes basic benchmarks for single-host
  storage and network traffic (between VMs).


WARNING
-------
  THESE SCRIPTS WILL DESTROY YOUR DATA. They will destroy SRs and VMs and
  overwrite large portions of your host's configuration and disk data. This is
  NOT TO BE USED IN PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENTS. It is intended for tests only.


Usage
-----
  1) Edit xsbench.cfg and adjust the parameters to meet your environment.
  2) Run ./xsbench.sh for a list of available commands.

  The suite operates on top of a base Linux (PV) VM. You should install a
  standard Linux guest and point the script to this guest's name (as "vm0").

  Once this is done, run:
  ./xsbench.sh setup

  This will create a pair of SSH keys and instruct your guest to accept
  commands from dom0 without a password (during this step you will be prompted
  for a password once). Furthermore, this action will install a set of required
  tools in dom0 and in your guest.

  Next, you can run:
  ./xsbench.sh srs_create     # Creates the specified SRs and VDIs for clones
  ./xsbench.sh clones_create  # Clones your base VM several times as configured
  ./xsbench.sh vbds_create    # Plugs the extra VDIs to the clones
  ./xsbench.sh bench_run      # Runs the benchmarks

  At the end of the benchmark, a set of 'gnuplottable' data files will be
  available for analysis.


Known issues and wishlist
-------------------------
  The "setup" functionality is not yet implemented. You are required to
  manually configure a base guest, install synexec, iperf, fio and latency.

  You are also required to configure the SSH keys.

  Path to guest tools (synexec, etc) is currently hard coded.

  The network performance tests are not yet distributed with this suite.

  This suite flushes iptables in dom0. Something more sensible is required.

  The implementation of "vbd_create()" could be better. Currently, it must be
  ran on halted guests.

  We are almost in a position to use 'fio' on all tests instead of 'latency'.
  The support for 'latency' could soon be dropped.

  Some functions will only work if the device name in the guest is "xvd_".
  This is incompatible with HVM Linux guests (device is called "hd_").

  There should be a better way to flip between tapdisk3, blktap2 and other
  data paths (e.g. qemu-qdisk, blkback).

  Ideally, this benchmark suite should run from a VM.

  Finally, once this suite is placed inside a VM, it should be modified to
  work with other hypervisors.

  It would be goot to have a './xsbench clean' to clean up the working dir.
